<p begin="00:00:00.220" end="00:00:15.430" style="s2">we really emphasize the ways in which strategies and ongoing iterative process</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.430" end="00:00:19.390" style="s2">that it is an incense essential part of what you do as a leader whether you</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.390" end="00:00:23.769" style="s2">think about what you're doing when you're doing it as strategy or not</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.769" end="00:00:28.210" style="s2">so you're doing strategy all the time every time you make a decision because</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.210" end="00:00:32.380" style="s2">of the most basic level strategy is just about deciding how to allocate your</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.380" end="00:00:33.550" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.550" end="00:00:37.270" style="s2">so every time you make a decision about whether to buys inputs from one supplier</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.270" end="00:00:43.840" style="s2">or another or whether to you know invest in this facility or to do this marketing</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.840" end="00:00:44.590" style="s2">plan</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.590" end="00:00:48.820" style="s2">you're doing strategy and in our fundamental view is it's better to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.820" end="00:00:53.020" style="s2">that self-consciously and to be aware that you're doing it and to not be aware</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.020" end="00:00:59.500" style="s2">of it and so I think we oftentimes kind of could benefit from demystifying what</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.500" end="00:01:04.420" style="s2">strategy is and just realize that a lot of us in a lot of different managerial</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.420" end="00:01:08.650" style="s2">and leadership roles are doing strategy all the time and it's better to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.650" end="00:01:11.860" style="s2">self-reflective about it than to be doing it blindly</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.860" end="00:01:20.170" style="s2">a strong leader is somebody who who was almost able to think like a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.170" end="00:01:26.020" style="s2">who's constantly able to move back and forth between the kind of the conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.020" end="00:01:31.330" style="s2">model or the the theory of the way they think the world works and the reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.330" end="00:01:34.750" style="s2">that they're encountering and then they're able to translate the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.750" end="00:01:40.930" style="s2">experiences that were having or that you're having as a group into a sensible</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.930" end="00:01:43.780" style="s2">way of thinking about the world that the rest of the group can really get on</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.780" end="00:01:47.710" style="s2">board with and I think so really what leaders do is they kind of build a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.710" end="00:01:52.780" style="s2">community right that the responsibility of a leader is to think about the group</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.780" end="00:01:56.410" style="s2">as a whole in the social group that they're operating in a manager is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.410" end="00:02:01.030" style="s2">usually more concerned with kind of technical aspects of of getting the job</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.030" end="00:02:06.340" style="s2">done so how do I build kind of the most efficient process but people also need a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.340" end="00:02:10.060" style="s2">sense of belonging and they need a sense of kind of community in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.060" end="00:02:13.060" style="s2">purpose and I think that's really what the leaders goal is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.760" end="00:02:22.340" style="s2">you have a plan that you want to execute and part of your job as Gigi leader is</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.340" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">really to turn that plan into coherent action right and part of that is about</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:30.799" style="s2">what investment decisions you make and how you allocate your resources but a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.799" end="00:02:35.209" style="s2">lot of it is also about how you organize your people and the way you structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.209" end="00:02:38.690" style="s2">the incentives the way you structure reporting relationships how much</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.690" end="00:02:41.959" style="s2">attention you pay to the culture what kind of culture that you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.959" end="00:02:46.280" style="s2">and even at the level of things that we think of as kind of HR like things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.280" end="00:02:49.099" style="s2">recruiting and who it is you're going to bring onto the team</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.099" end="00:02:52.099" style="s2">those things are all incredibly important because if you don't have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.099" end="00:02:56.540" style="s2">alignment between the way you've set up your organization and the strategy</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.540" end="00:02:59.870" style="s2">you're trying to accomplish and kind of the key assumptions in that strategy</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.870" end="00:03:02.989" style="s2">you're not going to be successful</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.989" end="00:03:10.220" style="s2">I think the core question and strategy is about you know when you have an</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.220" end="00:03:13.430" style="s2">innovation or when you have an idea and you kind of see an opportunity there</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.810" end="00:03:19.670" style="s2">the problem that a lot of innovators run into is that they they focused almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.670" end="00:03:22.699" style="s2">entirely on the nature of the opportunity they really think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.699" end="00:03:25.940" style="s2">while this product is really going to do something different for people</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:31.609" style="s2">that's not easy to do right it is very hard to come up with great innovations</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.609" end="00:03:35.930" style="s2">but actually the harder part in the thing that we really emphasize in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.930" end="00:03:39.889" style="s2">course is it's not enough to come up with the innovation you also have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.889" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">come up with the plan for how you're going to profit from that innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:47.090" style="s2">that is oftentimes much more difficult and part of that and involves really</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.090" end="00:03:49.879" style="s2">recognizing what the obstacles are that stand in your way</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.879" end="00:03:53.959" style="s2">and those can be obstacles in terms of powerful buyers or suppliers that can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.959" end="00:03:57.650" style="s2">obstacles in terms of rivals or potential entrants into the industry</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.160" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">how do you build a plan how do you build a strategy that's going to allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:05.900" style="s2">overcome those obstacles because oftentimes you come to the table with</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.900" end="00:04:09.859" style="s2">this great insight about an innovation that's going to have value and there's a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.859" end="00:04:13.490" style="s2">lot of work and getting to that point and we really hate to see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.490" end="00:04:17.150" style="s2">the work that you've done up into that . go to waste because you never figured</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.150" end="00:04:25.160" style="s2">out how to actually capture the value that you're generating so I think you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.160" end="00:04:28.940" style="s2">know when we think about leadership we tend to to think about particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.940" end="00:04:33.290" style="s2">individuals right so we think about Gandhi or Martin Luther King or Steve</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.290" end="00:04:38.270" style="s2">Jobs or kind of these great figures that we kind of all kind of think of as role</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.270" end="00:04:42.410" style="s2">models and and I think it's important to learn lessons from people like that but</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.410" end="00:04:46.310" style="s2">I think it's also important to remember that you are who you are and that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.310" end="00:04:49.640" style="s2">have your own personality that you bring to the table and your own strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.640" end="00:04:53.870" style="s2">your own weaknesses and that effective leaders are ones who recognize what</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.870" end="00:04:57.350" style="s2">their strengths are and recognize what their weaknesses are and build their</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.350" end="00:05:01.940" style="s2">leadership style around that and it's really important to have alignment</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.940" end="00:05:05.480" style="s2">between what your leadership style is and the kind of organization that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.480" end="00:05:08.810" style="s2">build and the kind of strategy that you that you pursue</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.810" end="00:05:14.780" style="s2">I think we too much too great of an extent think about leaders as something</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.780" end="00:05:16.130" style="s2">that is an eight</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.130" end="00:05:19.400" style="s2">I think everybody has leadership potential and it is something that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.400" end="00:05:27.590" style="s2">can develop over time I think it can be learned by turning to others and asking</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.590" end="00:05:34.730" style="s2">them for kind of you know in depth and and kind of brutally honest kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.730" end="00:05:37.910" style="s2">assessment of what what your strengths and weaknesses are</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.910" end="00:05:41.000" style="s2">I don't think there's any doubt though that that everybody has the potential to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.000" end="00:05:45.620" style="s2">be a powerful leader in the right situation and at the right time</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:51.320" style="s2">yeah</p>
